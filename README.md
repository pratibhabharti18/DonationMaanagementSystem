# DonationMaanagementSystem
The Donation Management System is a full-stack web-based application designed to streamline and manage the donation process for NGOs, donors, and administrators. This project was developed to address common challenges faced by non-profit organizations, such as manual tracking, lack of transparency, and inefficient donor engagement.
